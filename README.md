# ERPRO

This repository is a school project revolving around an ERP system.  
ERPRO features different functionalities under the subjects:  
 - Domain model
 - Product
 - Customers
 - Sales
 - Companies
 - Database
 ERPRO features the usage of a MSSQL Database as backend.  
 The UI used is a (baby)framework called TECHCOOL made by Simon.

 



## Usage

To use ERPRO locally download the github repository.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.

Run 'dotnet run'
## FAQ

#### Is ERPRO a fully functional ERP System?

Big nono. It should NEVER be used as a reference for a real ERP system.

#### Can you travel in time?

Again a big nono.
